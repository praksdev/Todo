The Todo app is loosely based on the MVC concepts where 

The Model stores the data for the app.
when a model changes, it notifies its observers that a change has occurred.

View is used to interact with the app

Controller is the glue between Model and the View.It updates the view when the model changes. 
It also adds event listeners to the view and updates the model when the user manipulates the view.


Some of the functionality is as below

1)Add an Item
2)Mark an item as "complete"
3)Toggle the item from its "complete" status to "Active" status
4)Show all items in the list
5)Show only Active items
6)Show only completed items
7)The items are already sorted by id's in ascending order.You can also sort by latest whihc does a descending sort
8)Clear the complete list
9)Show the total count and remaining count of items
